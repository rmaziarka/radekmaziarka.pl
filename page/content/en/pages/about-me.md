My name is Radek Maziarka. On a daily basis, I work as a Solution Architect. Additionally:

 *   I conduct internal presentations and trainings in the company
 *   As part of the RadSoft company I provide IT consulting
 *   I organize [WROC# Online](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYVo-vlwRSOrwFEFlMhpamAXJxn5Oz8MD) webinar
 *   This is my blog ;) check my [latest posts](/blog)
 *   I support IT architecture of [Libertarian Association](http://slib.pl/en/about-us/)

All these aspects make me look broadly at the software development - I do not close myself to one technology - I try to provide the greatest value to my clients based on all available tools. I am a big advocate of spreading knowledge and I want to share it with others.
