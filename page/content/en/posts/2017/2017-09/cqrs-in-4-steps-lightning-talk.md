I finished work on my lightning talk about "CQRS in 4 steps" and successfully presented it to my [company](http://www.objectivity.co.uk/)'s folks.

You can find slides from my presentation on [Slideshare](https://www.slideshare.net/RadosawMaziarka/cqrs-in-4-steps-79849141) and download it from my [OneDrive](https://1drv.ms/p/s!AjEySs0anBSPgbNzSeGrhDXYPsX9sw) to get my inside notes ;)
